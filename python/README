This is a Python code for modeling Air-Quality in urban areas.
This code is to be used in the Air-Quality project website at University of Utah.

You can use the "AQ_DataQuery_API" to get data at time span and gps box that you want with a desired frequency as follows
python AQ_DataQuery_API start-date end-date binning-frequency right-longitude bottom-latitude left-longitude top-latitude
example:
python AQ_DataQuery_API 2017-07-16 2017-07-21 12:00:00 -109.0411 36.9979 -114.0539 42.0013

And the main API to be used for modeling is "AQ_API.py".
